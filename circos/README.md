# Circos example for cancer data

The notebooks here follow closely to [this online tutorial](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/visualisation/tutorials/circos/tutorial.html#example-cancer-genomics).

There is both a Python and R version showing the same workflow, analyzing the same data and producing the same plot.  The Python version is available in a Jupyter notebook .ipynb file.  The R version is also available as a .ipynb file, and also as an R Markdown (.Rmd) file and a rendered .html file.

## Downloading data

I did not include the data here because it is already hosted online elsewhere.  I included a cell in the Python notebook (and R Markdown notebook) to download the data.  Alternatively, you can do it manually following:

1. Create a ```data``` directory here.
2. In ```data``` download the files from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4494146#.YwaTwPHMIas).
