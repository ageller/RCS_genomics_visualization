Tutorials on how to create typical plots with genomics data


## Downloading data

I did not include the data here because it is already hosted online elsewhere.  In order to run the notebooks in this repo, you need to do the following:

1. Create directories here for ```data/heatmap``` and ```data/circos```
2. In ```data/heatmap``` download the files from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2529926#.YwaRPfHMIas).
3. In ```data/circos``` download the files from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4494146#.YwaTwPHMIas).
