# Downloading data

I did not include the data here because it is already hosted online elsewhere.  I included a cell in the Python notebook (and R Markdown notebook) to download the data.  Alternatively, you can do it manually following:

1. Create directories here for ```data/heatmap``` and ```data/circos```
2. In ```data/heatmap``` download the files from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/2529926#.YwaRPfHMIas).
3. In ```data/circos``` download the files from [here](https://zenodo.org/record/4494146#.YwaTwPHMIas).
